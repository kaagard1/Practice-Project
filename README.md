Home Credit Kaggle Competion: 
This project focused on identifying potential customers who lack sufficient credit history for traditional credit approval but are at low risk of defaulting on a loan. The objective was to build a predictive model that improves our ability to accurately identify who will and will not default.
Our model combined the application, bureau, and bureau_balance datasets, resulting in a 29% improvement in the positive prediction rate. This enhancement could allow Home Credit to expand its lending population by 13.6%, potentially increasing annual revenue by $61 million.
One major challenge was dealing with missing data across a large number of predictors, which made it difficult to maintain a sample size large enough for generalizable predictions. We also had to balance model accuracy with computational efficiency.
For this project, I conducted the exploratory data analysis on the application and bureau datasets. I also cleaned and merged the bureau and bureau_balance files into a single dataframe. Additionally, I researched Home Creditâ€™s customer base and business practices in the Philippines, which served as the basis for our revenue projections. This was my first experience working with gradient boosting and the XGBoost library and working with a larger data set that had not been cleaned previously.
Finally, I created the gradient boosting model that we selected as our final solution. It outperformed all other candidate models.
