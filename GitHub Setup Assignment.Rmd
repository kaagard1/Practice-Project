## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
head(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
```{r}
# Define n
n <- 1000

# Empty data frame for 1000 simulated days
data <- data.frame(day = seq(1:n),
                demand = NA, # demand in Rockport
                quantity = NA, # quantity sold
                price = NA, # price per pound
                cost = 10000, # cost of daily operations
                earnings = NA) 

gt(data)

```

```{r}

set.seed(123)

sim <- data |>
  mutate(demand = sample(c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000),
                         size = n,
                         replace = T,
                         prob = c(.02, .03, .05, .08, .33, .29, .2)),
         quantity = ifelse(demand < 3500, demand, 3500),
         price = rnorm(n = n, mean = 3.65, sd = .2),
         earnings = price * quantity - cost)

gt(sim)
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
